    '''TextLog(filepath, console=True, create_ok=True)

    The TextLog logger logs per-epoch information in a human-readable way
    to a simple text file, and optionally to the command line.

    The output has the following form:

        "Epoch E (lr=LR, time=T): Train [loss (acc)]  Val [loss (acc)]  "

    where E is the epoch number, LR is the current learning rate, and T is
    running time for both training and evaluation.

    Args:
        filepath (str or Path): Path to the log file.
        console (bool): Whether to print log information to the commandline.
            Default: True.
        create_ok (bool): If True, allows the creation of any missing
            folders along the path to logfile. Default: True.
